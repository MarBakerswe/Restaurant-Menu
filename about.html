<h2>Origin Story</h2>

            <p class="content-justify">Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with strong aromatic components and a spicy edge. 
            Australian chef David Thompson, an expert on Thai food, observes that unlike many other cuisines,Thai 
            cooking is "about the juggling of disparate elements to create a harmonious finish. Like a complex musical 
            chord it's got to have a smooth surface but it doesn't matter what's happening underneath. Simplicity isn't 
            the dictum here, at all."</p>
            
            <p class="content-justify">Traditional Thai cuisine loosely falls into four categories: tom (boiled dishes), 
            yam (spicy salads), tam (pounded foods), and gaeng (curries). Deep-fries, stir-fries, and steamed dishes derive 
            from Chinese cuisine.</p>
